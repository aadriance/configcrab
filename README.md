# ConfigCrab

Config crab is a simple rust project to help manage config files.

At the moment it doesn't actually do that.

I normally start small projects and then they get lost as I move between
Computers.  I've decided to develop this one "in public" and to help motivate
progress.

This is my attempt to start ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) more.
