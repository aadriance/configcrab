# ConfigCrab

Config crab is a simple rust project to help manage config files.

At the moment it doesn't actually do that.

I normally start small projects and then they get lost as I move between
Computers.  I've decided to develop this one "in public" and to help motivate
progress.

This is my attempt to start ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) more.

## Vision

ConfigCrab should have two main features
- Install: Copys all config files to desired locations
- Sync: Copys newer config files

ConfigCrab should have an easy config file that describes where items
are placed based on OS being run. It should have a way to edit/generate
this info from the CLI and it should be human readable/editable.

If things go really well and I have nothing else to do, maybe I'll prebuild
some default locations for common things like vim and vscode.
